> first rust-project. i am confusion. but in a good way.

________________________________________________________________________

**bugs / to be fixed eventually**

- [ ] sometimes has error when already guessed char is put in
- [ ] can not handle uppercase inputs
- [x] ~~user cannot see previous attempts~~


**idea dump for things i might add**

- libraries (momentan werden noch Vektoren benutzt)
- levels (verschiedene libraries mit unterschiedlich schweren WÃ¶rtern)
- ~~eigenes random number generator~~ 
- ~~option for multiple rounds~~ 
- pay to win option to buy more attempts (stonks)

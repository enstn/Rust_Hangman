# Rust_Hangman
first rust-project. I am confusion. but in a good way.


TO BE FIXED:
-sometimes has error when already guessed char is put in
-can not handle uppercase inputs 

IDEA DUMP FOR IMPROV.:
-libraries (momentan werden noch Vektoren benutzt)
-levels (verschiedene libraries mit unterschiedlich schweren Wörtern)
-eigenes random number generator 
-option for multiple rounds 
-pay to win option to buy more attempts (stonks)

________________________________________________________________________

also, here are the version updates:

//Version 1.1 - 1.3 (don´t know the exact time-line anymore)

-bare structure, can read in user input, store it in a string & compare with specific single chars
-a lot of println! & Hello Worlds
-added rand from rust standart library for random chars (first pvc attempt)
-added attempts limitation & guesses containing multiple chars (second pvc attempt) with underscore tranformation & thing_on_display
-added pvp
-restructered into functions for better overview between pvc & pvp

//Version 1.4

-a lot of println!(" ") for terminal aesthetics
-hangman ascii arts hell yeahhh
